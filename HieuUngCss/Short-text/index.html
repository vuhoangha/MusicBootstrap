    <span id="short-text-content">Sophisticated minimalism was always a core feat of ALEX UNDER's portfolio, with the Spanish producer also serving as the founder and label manager for much-acclaimed techno label CMYK Musik. After releases on iconic imprints such as Trapez, Soma or Plus 8, the Madrilenian - one of the most sought-after electronic artists in Spain - now presents OLAS DE QUILA QUINA, his very first outing for Kompakt. Three slick, enticing cuts show him comitted to rolling basslines, rising synths and snappy percussion, all embedded in the futuristic sound design Alex has been honing over the course of his career. Unfolding to the backdrop of brooding metallic drones, the title track only needs a handful of carefully processed sounds to tell a highly evocative story - a focussed, geometrical jam that nonetheless allows for freewheeling outbursts of creativity. The same can be said for the punching, asymmetrical acid of EL REFLEJO DEL LACAR and the full-bodied bass bounce of LOLOG, as both cuts juxtapose sharp-edged shards of electronic texture with chewy, melodic synths. Tension-filled and catchy, it's a masterful update on ALEX UNDER's unique approach to techno, bold and subtle at the same time.
